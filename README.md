# Vim It Up ðŸ”¥
### A collection of scripts, plugins, and clever hacks so that you can exit vim in STYLE! ðŸš€

(Not that you would want to, ever... MUAHAHAHA)

[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

Some of the settings here may reference a 'leader' key, use:
```vim
let mapleader="{Your Key Of Choice}"
```

## Sane-er Defaults

Enables syntax highlighting, why wouldn't you?
```vim
syntax on
```

Shows you line numbers, it's great:
```vim
set number
```

Copy and paste from the **system** clipboard, and avoid indentation issues:
```vim
noremap <leader>y "+y
noremap <leader>p "+p
```

Makes the backspace key behave like you'd expect, and go through EVERYTHING:
```vim
set backspace=indent,eol,start
```

Makes 1 tab = 4 spaces:
```vim
set shiftwidth=4
set tabstop=4
```

Always try to show 10 lines above and below the cursor location:
```vim
set scrolloff=10
```

## Avoiding RSI

If you use command mode a lot, swapping the colon and semi-colon keys means 1 less keypress:
```vim
nnoremap ; :
nnoremap : ;
```
## Nicer Navigation
Allows the cursor to move up and down naturally by display, lines instead of file lines:
```vim
nnoremap j gj
nnoremap k gk
```

Make yanking with capital Y behave like the other capital letters, and yank until the end of the line:
```vim
nnoremap Y y$
```

Press space to go down 10 lines, control + space to go up 10 lines:
```vim
nnoremap <Space> 10j
nnoremap <C-Space> 10k
vnoremap <Space> 10j
vnoremap <C-Space> 10k
```

## File and Buffer Navigation, but better
Press space twice to switch between your last two buffers, use it all the time for superfast switching:
```vim
nnoremap <leader><leader> <c-^>
```

Switch buffers with Left and Right arrow keys:
```vim
nnoremap <left> :bp<cr>
nnoremap <right> :bn<cr>
```

## Text searching

Searching ignores case unless an upper case letter is present in the query:
```vim
set ignorecase smartcase
```
Begin searching while typing, hightlighting matches:
```vim
set incsearch hlsearch
```

Press your 'leader' key + enter to clear search highlighting:
```vim
nnoremap <silent> <leader><CR> :noh<CR>
```

## Super-Cool Plugins
