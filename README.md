# Vim

Some of the settings here may reference a 'leader' key, use:
```vim
let mapleader="{Your Key Of Choice}"
```

## Sane-er Defaults

Enables syntax highlighting, why wouldn't you?
```vim
syntax on
```

Shows you line numbers, it's great:
```vim
set number
```

Copy and paste from the **system** clipboard, and avoid indentation issues:
```vim
noremap <leader>y "+y
noremap <leader>p "+p
```

Makes the backspace key behave like you'd expect, and go through EVERYTHING:
```vim
set backspace=indent,eol,start
```

Makes 1 tab = 4 spaces:
```vim
set shiftwidth=4
set tabstop=4
```

Convert tabs to spaces:
```vim
set expandtab
```

Always try to show 10 lines above and below the cursor location:
```vim
set scrolloff=10
```

Allows you to switch between buffers without saving EVERY TIME:
```vim
set hidden
```

Case insensitive in `command-line` mode:
```vim
set wildignorecase
```

Change to the correct indention and plugins dependent on the file type
```vim
filetype on
filetype indent on
filetype plugin on
" or one line alternative
filetype plugin indent on
```

## KO Key-Strokes

### Normal mode

Visually select the entire file:
```vim
ggVG
```

Search for the word under the cursor (forward):
```vim
*
```

Search for the word under the cursor (backward):
```vim
#
```

Re-run the last `command-line` command:
```vim
@:
```

### Insert mode

Alternative to `Esc`:
```vim
<C-[>
```

Paste the content of register and fix the indent:
```vim
<C-r><C-p><vim-register>
" for example: <C-r><C-p>+ (paste clipboard content into vim)
```

Delete until the beginning of recently added word:
```vim
<C-w>
```

Delete until the beginning of where entering insert mode:
```vim
<C-u>
```

### Visual mode

Add/minus number for each matching line:
```vim
g<C-a> " add one number
g<C-x> " minus one number
" for example:
" select the number below using Visual block command:
" 0
" 0
" 0
" if we use g<C-a>, then those three line will become:
" 1
" 2
" 3
```

## Handy-Dandy Commands

Reads and inserts the contents of a file at the current line:
```vim
:r {your file name}
```

Reads and inserts the output of a shell command at the current line:
```vim
:r! {your shell command, eg: ls}
```

Find and replace "foo" with "bar" through whole file!
```vim
:%s/foo/bar/g
```

## Remaps, Baby!

Move visual selection up and down a line:
```vim
vnoremap J :m '>+1<CR>gv=gv
vnoremap K :m '<-2<CR>gv=gv
```
Quickly re-select either the last pasted or changed text:
```vim
noremap gV `[v`]
```

Run the recorded macro on a range of lines:

```vim
" Credit goes to https://github.com/stoeffel/.dotfiles/blob/master/vim/visual-at.vim
xnoremap <silen> @ :<C-u>echo "@".getcmdline() | execute ":\'<,\'>normal @" . nr2char(getchar())<CR>
```

## Avoiding RSI

If you use command mode a lot, swapping the colon and semi-colon keys means 1 less keypress:
```vim
nnoremap ; :
nnoremap : ;
```

Write to and exit the file, behaves like `:wq`:
```vim
ZZ
```

Exit without saving, behaves like `:q!`:
```vim
ZQ
```

Run the current line as a command:
```vim
:<Ctrl-r> <Ctrl-l>
```

## Nicer Navigation

Allows the cursor to move up and down naturally by display, lines instead of file lines:
```vim
nnoremap j gj
nnoremap k gk
```

Make yanking with capital Y behave like the other capital letters, and yank until the end of the line:
```vim
nnoremap Y y$
```

Press space to go down 10 lines, control + space to go up 10 lines:
```vim
noremap <Space> 10j
noremap <C-Space> 10k
" if there's an issue with ctrl-space, you can use <C-@> or <Nul>
" Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/a/24983736
noremap <C-@> 10k
```

## File and Buffer Navigation (but better)

Press space twice to switch between your last two buffers, use it all the time for superfast switching:
```vim
nnoremap <leader><leader> <c-^>
```

Switch buffers with Left and Right arrow keys:
```vim
nnoremap <left> :bp<cr>
nnoremap <right> :bn<cr>
```

## Text searching

Search for foo throughout file (press n for next, N for previous):
```vim
/foo
```

Searching ignores case unless an upper case letter is present in the query:
```vim
set ignorecase smartcase
```

Begin searching while typing, highlighting matches:
```vim
set incsearch hlsearch
```

Press your 'leader' key + enter to clear search highlighting:
```vim
nnoremap <silent> <leader><CR> :noh<CR>
```

## Super-Cool Plugins

# TMUX

Most of the settings here require a prefix key, use this to set it, or keep it as ctrl+b, it's your life ;)
```tmux
unbind C-b
set -g prefix {Your Key Of Choice}
```

## Better Life, From the Start!

Tmux Windows start from 1, so no big reaches ;)
```tmux
set -g base-index 1
```

Makes keys register instantly, you may notice escape delays in vim without this:
```tmux
set -s escape-time 0
```

Prefix+c will open a new tmux session in your current directory:
```tmux
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
```

Renumber windows sequentially after closing any of them:
```tmux
set -g renumber-windows on
```

Enable mouse, it's sometimes nice for scrolling:
```tmux
set -g mode-mouse on
```

Increase scroll-back history, so you can see more:
```tmux
set -g history-limit 10000
```

## Plugins That Rock!

Installing TPM (Tmux plugin manager):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

A set of tmux options that should be acceptable to everyone.

## Oh-My-ZSH

Gives you more customization over your shell
